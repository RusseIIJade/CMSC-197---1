       "'The mailing list I queried about a few weeks ago is now up and\\nrunning.  I have also set up an archive server; see below.  The\\nfollowing is the official welcome to the list message at the moment.\\n\\nJoe Buehler\\n\\n--------------------\\n\\nThis mailing list is for people who desire serious, orthodox\\ndiscussion of the Roman Catholic religion.  I assume that it will\\ncater mainly to Catholics, but everyone else is welcome, provided they\\noperate within the below guidelines.  My own interests have a\\ndoctrinal bent, but I\\'m certainly not going to limit this list to just\\nthat sort of discussion.\\n\\nHaving participated in USENET religion groups for about 5 years now,\\none of my primary observations about Catholics on the net is that they\\ndo not know their religion very well.  My hope is that this list might\\nhelp remedy this problem to some extent.  I would like to make this a\\nnet resource available for Catholics who want to know more about their\\nreligion.\\n\\nAs far as moderation policy goes: The Catholic Church is not a\\ndemocracy, it\\'s a monarchy subject to a divinely given constitution.\\nI don\\'t set the rules in the Church, neither does my parish priest,\\nnor does my bishop, nor does the Pope.  Everyone has to adhere to the\\nway Christ set things up.  I think it follows that it\\'s not really\\nappropriate for someone to call himself a Catholic and argue with this\\nstate of affairs.  If you want to be Catholic, it\\'s simple enough, you\\nhave to follow the teaching of the Church.\\n\\nThe moderation policy will reflect this way of thinking: there are\\nplenty of other places on the net where Catholic doctrine can be\\nfreely attacked!  If in doubt, you can always subscribe, and see\\nwhether the list is to your taste.\\n\\nBesides the mailing list, there are a few other things that may be of\\ninterest:\\n\\n- I have set up an archive server that we can put interesting things\\nin.  (It doesn\\'t have anything in it at the moment except some UNIX\\nsoftware useful for such endeavors.)  Sorry, guys, but nothing that\\'s\\ncopyrighted goes into it!\\n\\n- I am planning on setting up a quotation server that can email\\nperiodic interesting citations from the principal sources of Catholic\\ndoctrine.  (Not done yet.)\\n\\n- I have obtained permission from the English language publishers of\\nthe Italian Catholic magazine \"30 Days\" to take material from their\\nmagazine.  I intend to scan some of the more interesting pictures\\n(ever seen a Cristero?  or St. Pius X?) and put them in the archives,\\nand also post extracts from some of the more interesting articles.\\n(It\\'s a European magazine, and is of generally higher quality than\\nAmerican Catholic material.  In my opinion...)\\n\\nIf you have any questions, would like to subscribe, etc., send email\\nto\\n\\n\\tcatholic@sarto.budd-lake.nj.us\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
